    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A thematic single-page application. The structure begins with a hero section, followed by a sticky navigation bar for easy access to three main interactive sections: 1. "The Journey," an interactive vertical timeline combining childhood and career. 2. "Skills & Growth," a dashboard with comparison cards. 3. "Life Lessons," a clickable card grid with modals. This structure was chosen to transform a linear narrative into an engaging, non-linear exploration, allowing users to digest the information in visually appealing, bite-sized chunks. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Career Path -> Goal: Show progression -> Method: Interactive vertical timeline (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click to reveal details -> Justification: More engaging than text, visualizes time flow.
        - Personal Growth -> Goal: Show transformation -> Method: Side-by-side cards (HTML/CSS) -> Interaction: Static display -> Justification: Simple, clear visual metaphor for change.
        - Life Lessons -> Goal: Organize distinct points -> Method: Interactive Card Grid with Modals (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click to open modal with details -> Justification: Breaks down a long list into a digestible, explorable format.

                            <li>**Traveling:** Exploring new places and cultures whenever I get the chance is a huge passion. Some of my favorite adventures include trips to Bali, Lombok, Ijen Craters, Labuan Bajo, Papandayan Mountain, the Southern Java Coast, Ujung Kulon, Ujung Genteng, Sukabumi, Kelimutu Crater, Bromo Mountain, Tangkuban Parahu Crater, and Ambon.</li>
                            <li>**Baking:** When I'm looking for a creative outlet, you'll often find me in the kitchen. I particularly enjoy baking buns and love experimenting with different methods like Yudane and Thang Zhong to perfect my recipes.</li>
                            <li>**Tech Observer:** I love keeping up with the latest in technology, exploring both hardware and software. This includes diving into smartphone and OS evolution, as well as PC components like motherboards, memory, CPUs, and GPUs.</li>
                            <li>**Gaming:** Unwinding with a good game is always a great way to relax! I especially enjoy RPG (Role-Playing Games), simulation games, and turn-based strategy games.</li>

My early years there were with my mom, who raised me as a single parent since I was three. My school days started at Kalam Kudus, then I moved to St. Aloysius for high school. I was mostly a homebody, not really hanging out much until high school.`

During college, my interest in embedded system programming, chip design, and microprocessor architecture truly blossomed. My final year project was a challenging but rewarding experience: building a 4G LTE hardware decoder and encoder on an FPGA board. It was also during my 6th semester that I earned a full scholarship for a 6-month student exchange program in Kumoh, South Korea, which was a fantastic opportunity to broaden my perspective.`

This role was a perfect bridge from my hardware background, as I started by developing embedded software for EDC payment terminals. It was fascinating to see how low-level programming directly impacted physical devices. Soon after, I seized the chance to pivot into high-level software development, learning Java, Spring Boot, and the Linux command-line interface to help build a robust payment gateway system from the ground up. This shift was heavily influenced by my observations during my South Korea exchange, where I saw Indonesia's manufacturing lagging, making software a more dynamic career path here.`

I initially joined as a QA Engineer, which was a strategic move to understand the entire product lifecycle from a quality assurance perspective. I built automated testing systems using Selenium and Appium, ensuring our user interfaces were robust and reliable. This role gave me invaluable insight into how different parts of the system interact and the importance of thorough testing.`

                    content: `After about a year in QA, I transitioned to the Frontend Engineer team at Ninja Van, where I focused on developing critical dashboards with Angular JS for managing parcel lifecycles. This expanded my understanding of user experience and front-end architecture. Then, in 2018, amidst Ninja Van's aggressive engineering team expansion, I moved into a Backend Engineer role. Here, I gained deep expertise in building robust Java web applications using the Play Framework, specifically working on optimizing our complex inter-warehouse management systems, which involved tackling significant logistical and data challenges with code.`

Recognizing this critical need, I decided to step up and take on that leadership role. This was a pivotal moment in my career, marking my transition from a purely technical individual contributor to leading and mentoring a growing team.

                    content: `My leadership responsibilities expanded significantly in 2021. When the former head of the Indonesia tech lab departed, I was appointed to lead the ID tech lab, double-hatted with overseeing the entire regional QA team across Ninja Van, managing 3 managers under my direct supervision. Then, in 2023, following some company-wide restructuring and downsizing, I was officially made Head of QA for the entire region, overseeing both the Indonesia and Vietnam teams, which totaled 36 people. This journey has been incredibly enriching, teaching me profound lessons in managing diverse, cross-cultural teams, understanding unique regional challenges, and maintaining strong work standards and processes across different geographical locations, a responsibility I continue to uphold today.`
