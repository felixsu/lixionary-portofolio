					<p class="mb-4">
						I grew up in <strong>Bandung, Indonesia</strong>, a city I just loved for its super mild temperatures. It's nestled in this natural basin, surrounded by amazing volcanic mountains, which kept things much cooler year-round – a nice break from the usual Indonesian heat! My early years there were with my mom, who raised me as a single parent since I was three.

				<p class="mb-4">
					As a kid, I was mostly a homebody, not really hanging out much until high school. That's when my interest in tech really took off! PCs and early cell phones, like my favorite Nokia N73, totally grabbed my attention. I had a blast tinkering with computers, even back when upgrading GPUs and SATA hard drives was a thing. In class, I was all about Math, Physics, and Chemistry, loving anything that was quantifiable and measurable. I know now that being so rigid isn't always the best way to live, but hey, that's just how I was back then!

				<p class="mb-4">
					My personal growth really started to pick up in high school, when I began to see how rigid I used to be, always sticking to theories and rules. After a couple of years navigating the social side of the professional world, I realized that life isn't always black and white; people see things from all sorts of angles, and there's no single "absolute truth." Holding onto my old ideals just held me back from trying new things and gaining more experience. That's when I started to loosen up and become more open to different ideas.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">
					I'm always eager to learn something new, especially in the fast-paced world of technology. This intrinsic drive is a big part of why I'm so happy with what I've achieved today. Another huge step for me has been building empathy for how differently people think and what they prefer. This understanding hasn't just helped me make more friends and even find my life partner, but it's also been super important in growing my career as a leader of a big team at my company.

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Real-World Lessons and Experiences</h2>
				<p class="mb-4">
					Like I said, I used to be pretty rigid and idealistic, always following the rules and getting frustrated when others didn't. But one of my biggest "teachers" was a public service experience, specifically when I needed to get my nationality documents. Back in 2012, I was applying for my first passport for a student exchange in Kumoh, South Korea. After a long wait, the officer told me my birth certificate was wrong and I needed an extra letter from Dukcapil. Ugh! That meant two more days just to get my application in, dealing with unexpected bureaucracy and delays.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">
					At the same time, I was juggling so much: planning my trip, buying tickets, getting my visa, and setting up a bank account for Korea. The thought of spending so much money on a flight ticket back then made me really anxious, adding another layer of stress to an already frustrating situation.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">
					This whole ordeal really hammered home that what I learned in school was just a tiny piece of life. There's so much stuff you don't get taught, and you just have to experience it to truly understand. My parents weren't really big on teaching me how to navigate life in this country or deal with people, so I had to figure it all out on my own.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-4">
					Here are some of those key life lessons I picked up along the way, often through trial and error:
				</p>

				<div class="lessons-container">
					<div class="card">
						<div class="card-header">It’s okay to do mistake, it built your maturity, to accept imperfection.</div>
						<div class="card-content">
							<p>I learned that perfection is an illusion, and real growth comes from acknowledging errors, learning from them, and moving forward. This shift helped me become a more resilient and understanding person, both personally and professionally.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="card">
						<div class="card-header">Give respect, being humble to the people around you.</div>
						<div class="card-content">
							<p>I found that approaching interactions with humility and genuine respect, even when faced with challenging personalities or situations, fosters much more positive outcomes. It's about building bridges, not burning them.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="card">
						<div class="card-header">Any commitment you made has its own consequences, and you need to deal with it.</div>
						<div class="card-content">
							<p>Whether it's a small promise to a friend or a major professional decision, I've learned the importance of accountability. Understanding that every action has a ripple effect has made me more deliberate and responsible in my choices.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="card">
						<div class="card-header">We live inside a system, and we need to adapt with it.</div>
						<div class="card-content">
							<p>Life isn't always about ideal scenarios or textbook rules. I've realized that society, laws, and cultural norms form complex systems. Learning to understand these systems, navigate their constraints, and adapt my approach is crucial for achieving goals and living harmoniously, rather than constantly fighting against the current.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p class="mt-4">
					These points became clear after navigating life with friends, colleagues, and my wife, where administration, law, and culture served as very real constraints that require understanding and adaptation to live and thrive.
